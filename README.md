# Transfer Systems
This repo hosts code which enumerates cosaturated transfer systems on groups or posets.
Currently, there is a section for Rust code and for Sage code.
To be most precise, the Rust code enumerates the number of subhypermonoids of a hypersemilattice given in terms of its multiplication table.
The Sage code works similarly, but is able to produce the multiplication table from a group or a poset.
